# cs370-pirate-agent-project
Project for CS-370-10683 Current/Emerging Trends

    What code were you given?
For this pirate agent project, I was provided with the TreasureMaze.py, GameExperience.py, and a good chunk of the ipynb file completed. The maze, visuals, model, and some helper functions were already done, while my job was to complete the deep Q-learning and anywhere marked with TODOs.

    What code did you create yourself?
My job was to create the training loop in qtrain(). The loop handles:
•	Exploration vs. Exploitation
•	Taking actions
•	Storing episodes
•	Training the model with experience replay
•	Tracking wins
•	Exiting once win rate hits target

    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists use code to solve real-world and virtual problems. Nowadays, with most things running on software, and now with AI, we can use it to let software adapt and get better without being told exactly what to do.

    How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I start by understanding the pieces that have been provided, identifying a goal, getting an understanding of what the inputs and outputs will be, and making steps that I can use to solve the problem at hand. I like to break down the problem into separate groups, modularly write code to solve a piece of it, and test and tweak that section until it works.

    What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities include building functional programs that don't break, harm users, or steal data. I must also make sure the code is clean, understandable, and reliable. With the addition of AI, we must also make sure it learns the right things in a usable, responsible, and efficient manner.
